# Alfredo-s-Pizzeria
Analysis providing actionable insights on order tracking, stock control and staff management to improve operational efficiency, manage resources efficiently, and enhance customer satisfaction.

# Overview

I created this project to mimic the needs and challenges of a local food business that deals in take-outs and deliveries.

"Alfredo's" is the fictional name I attributed to the business; I purchased the dataset as it was not readily available. It was created from an actual pizza delivery business, but the names and addresses were replaced and randomised to protect names and likenesses.

The dataset consisted of three Excel files containing information about the orders delivered, stock and inventory, and staff information.

# Research Questions

As there were three books containing different kinds of information, several questions could be asked. I went through each of the books and penned down the following as potential needs that such a business would require:

# Orders Activity
Revenue by pizza type
Orders/sales by hour
Orders by location
Total orders and sales
Quantity of items sold

# Stock control/ Inventory management
When to order new stock?
What ingredients go into making each menu item?
How much does it cost to make each menu item?
Existing stock level?

# Staff Management
Work times for each staff
Pay-per-hour
Total amount of wages being paid
The total amount of working hours
